# Anagrams Solver!

---
## What is This?
This is a simplified version of the Arrange Word in Scrabble Game, available at <a href=https://github.com/njabdullah/ArrangeWordScrabble>GitHub</a>. In this code, users can obtain possible words that can be arranged using given letters. The output will be printed from the longest word to the shortest word, making it easier for users to input these words into an Anagram game.

## How is It Work?
This code prompts the user to input their letters without spacing. Once executed, it automatically displays the arranged words using the provided letters.

## About This Code
I've created an Anagrams Solver Code using Python 3.11, just for fun during my day off. The repository includes a virtual environment named 'anagrams'. There are two types of word lists included: one searches an English word list using an internal database I found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words?tab=readme-ov-file), and the other utilizes NLTK package (to switch to the other method, you can easily uncomment the code in the 'anagramssolver.py' file). I prefer using the internal database since I found some unreal English words in the NLTK package (though I still don't know why).
